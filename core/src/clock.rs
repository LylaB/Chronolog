/// [`SchedulerClock`] is a trait for implementing a custom scheduler clock, typical operations
/// include getting the current time, idle for a specific duration (or til a specific date is reached).
/// As it goes for implementations, by default, there are 2 of them:
///
/// - [`VirtualClock`] used to simulate time (for unit-tests, debugging,
/// [`flashcrowd`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flashcrowd#English) simulations... etc.), it doesn't
/// go forward without explicit advancing
///
/// - [`SystemClock`] the default go-to clock, it automatically goes forward and doesn't wait around
///
/// For implementing clocks which can advance their time, see the extension trait
/// [`AdvanceableScheduleClock`] for more information
///
/// **Note:** The precision of SchedulerClock can depend on the underlying OS-specific time format due
/// to the fact it uses `SystemTime` under the hood. For example, on Windows, the time is represented
/// in 100 nanosecond intervals, whereas Linux can represent nanosecond intervals... etc
