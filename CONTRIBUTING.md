# Getting Started
1. Fork the repository on GitHub:
![](assets/contributing/first_step.png)

2. Follow the process as outlined by GitHub:
![](assets/contributing/second_step.png)

3. Clone your fork locally:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/RandomContributor101/MY_FORK_NAME.git
    cd MY_FORK_NAME
    ```

4. Add the upstream remote to stay synced with the main project repo:
    ```shell
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/GitBrincie212/Chronolog.git
    ```
5. Ensure you have the latest Rust toolchain as the project uses the latest stable Rust. We recommend using 
[rustup](https://rustup.rs):
    ```shell
    rustup update stable
    ```
6. **(Optional)** Look into GitHub issues for any potential one that is good for newcomers and start by
there, implementing the feature, bug fixes or changes requested on the issue
7. Make your relevant code changes
8. Run the unit tests (and make your own depending on the changes) to ensure everything works:
    ```shell
    cargo test
    ```
9. Look into the [Styles Guidelines] Section and ensure everything is followed
10. Commit all your changes (you can commit multiple times without repeating the process 
for grouping various changes, which is one of the style guidelines)
    ```shell
    git commit -m "[COMMIT LABEL]..."
    # Common commit labels: FEATURE, FIX, DOCS, 
    # PERF, STYLE, REFACTOR, TEST, CHORE, CI
    ```

# Pull Request Process
1. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:
    ```shell
    git push origin YOUR_BRANCH
    ```
2. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the main branch of the upstream project repository.
3. Ensure you fill out relevant information, be descriptive about the issue such as what it addresses, why is it made,
link any relevant issues...etc.
4. Ensure all CI checks are passed. The PR will automatically be checked for formatting, lints, and tests.
5. Request a review from the owner (GitBrincie212).
6. Address review feedback. This may require changes to your code. Please be responsive and discuss 
any suggestions with the owner (GitBrincie212).
7. Once approved, the owner will squash and merge your PR.

# Styles Guide
- Before you push changes, make sure to use ``cargo clippy`` and ensure there is no warning (the exception is loop {} 
statements for testing to keep the script awake at all times)
- Once no warnings are shown, use ``cargo fmt`` and commit the changes
- Document every public method without being too brief or too descriptive, only relevant information should be documented,
Ideally you should have sections for:
  - ``# Example`` for example(s) section, list relevant simple examples **(MUST)**
  - ``# Panics`` if a method can panic with an error, document how it can panic and optionally how 
  it could be prevented **(MUST)**
  - ``# Errors`` if a method may return an error, it should be documented on what conditions it causes a method
  to fail and optionally how it could be prevented **(MUST)**
  - ``# Safety`` if a method is unsafe, explain why a function is unsafe and the invariants callers must uphold **(MUST)**
  - ``# Arguments`` if the method has argument(s), they should be explained what they are for **(MUST)**
  - ``# Returns`` if the method has a returned value, it should be explained what does it actually return **(MUST)**
  - ``# Implementation Details``  In case it is needed to explain the way the method is implemented. This should be
  used sparingly and shouldn't be the main focus **(OPTIONAL)**
  - ``# See Also`` If there are relevant structs/enums/traits... etc. Which are used, it is nice to have a see also
  section with a list of relevant instances **(OPTIONAL)**
  - ``# Performance`` for documenting how performant or slow the method is, ideally there should be suggestions
  whenever possible on methods or patterns which are more performant than this implementation as well as explaining
      why its slow **(OPTIONAL)**
- Group and sort imports consistently. We recommend using rust-analyzer's "Organize Imports" feature to ensure
consistency
