///
/// - **Lifecycle Task Events** These are automatically emitted by the scheduler, all task frames have this
///   event no matter the type. Currently, there are 2 of these, the first namely being ``on_start``
///   used for listening to when a task is about to start. While the second is ``on_end`` which is used
///   for listening to when a task is ending (this event executes before the error handler)
///
/// - **Local Task Events** These are local to the task frame, different task frames may have none, one
///   or multiple of these event types. They are emitted by the task frame logic and give more extensibility
///   to what outside parties can listen to (for example, on the fallback task frame, one can listen to
///   when the fallback is about to execute)
///
/// [`TaskEvent`] **CANNOT** be emitted by itself, it needs an emitter which is only handed to the
/// scheduler, overlapping policies and the task frame. Outside parties can listen to the event at any
/// time they would like
